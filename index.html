    <h2 class="h2">Shark Tank is a one of the most inspiring shows for Budding entrepreneurs who learn the basics of analyzing an idea, its worth and how to put it out in the markets. In this show, budding entrepreneurs pitch their business idea and provide details like profits, sales and most importantly the money they are expecting for a share in the equity. </h2>


     <h2 class="h2">There are 6 sharks who are a part of the show namely: Mark Cuban, Robert Herjavec, Lori Greiner, Kevin O'Leary a.k.a Mr. Wonderful,Daymond John, Barbara Corcoran.</h2>

    <h2 class="h2"> My favorite out of all the sharks is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Cuban">Mark Cuban</a>, the owner of Dallas Mavericks and Landamrk pictures to name a few. </h2>
